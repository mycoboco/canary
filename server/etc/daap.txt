	       Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP)
		     Protocol documentation v0.2
                           daap@tapjam.net


I. Introduction


Apple introduced the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP[1]) with
iTunes4, to allow iTunes to share its library with other machines also
running iTunes.  iTunes uses the Rendezvous protocol[2], specifically
the multi-cast dns and service discovery bits, to find other local
machines that happen to be running iTunes and also sharing their
libraries.

Rendezvous is well documented in a number of places, and so it will
not be discussed here.  DAAP, on the other hand, in spite of having an
IANA defined port number, has yet to be documented.  This will
hopefully rectify that situation.

UPDATE: With iTunes 4.0.1 apple introduced a handful of changes that
break compatability with iTunes 4.0.  The changes are simply:

	o the version number is bumped to 2.0, from 1.0
	o the sessionid needs to be an unsigned integer, it looks
	  like the way session id's are created caused a signed
	  sessiondid, e.g. -9184 as a signed int, the string sessionid
	  needs to be unsigned, e.g. 4294958112 - I don't know if
	  this goes for all numeric values, or just sessionid
	
PART 1 - High level overview



II. DAAP Overview


DAAP, in a nutshell, is a fairly simple protocol.  Once iTunes has
found another instance, it will connect to, and download basic server
information about that instance.  It will then download a dictionary
of attributes that will be used at various other points in the
conversation.  iTunes then makes a series of DAAP requests to download
the list of songs from the server, as well as the various playlists of
those songs that the server has shared.  Finally, when iTunes wishes to
stream a song from the server, once again, a request is made to the
server to stream the selected track back to iTunes.  In addition,
there is a provision for allowing the client to pick up on when
changes are made to the server.

The iTunes implementation of DAAP imposes some restrictions.  Most
notably, it limits a user to 5 connections/sessions at any given
point.  Note, that a session doesn't necessarily have to be actively
streaming music to be counted to that five connections.  (The limit on
connections is actually 10, as a client may have up to two connections
to the server - one for the database/playlist updates, the other for
streaming).

Interestingly enough, the iTunes implementation of DAAP does not
restrict access to the local network.  This has lead to the rise of a
number of iTunes server repositories, including one that uses the DAAP
protocol to download the playlists of servers registered with it, and
uses that information to provide a search engine.


III. Under the Hood - the DAAP packet format


At it's heart, DAAP is the latest in a long line of protocols that
uses HTTP[3] as it's underlying transport mechanism.  It appears to
prefer using the connection-oriented HTTP/1.1 - though there is also
some support, it seems, for HTTP/1.0.  This document will focus on the
HTTP/1.1 implementation, and assume that the HTTP/1.0 implementation
is around for some strange legacy reason.

(Note: the specifics of writing HTTP clients and servers are beyond
the scope of this document.  There are a number of excellent libraries
and resources out there for providing this functionality, however).

While the requests are normal URLs (documented further below), the
responses have the mime-type application/x-dmap-tagged.  This type
appears to be a flattened form of a plist or xml formatted file.  (In
fact, it would be fairly trivial to write an x-dmap-tagged to xml
converter, with just a little bit of foreknowledge on the specific
tags).

The basic format of DAAP (expanded on below) is:

    4 byte tag | size (4 byte int) | data

where the length of the data is determined by the size.  The 4 byte
tag can be represented as either an integer, or as a four character
string.  (Of course, the characters in that string form the bytes of
the 4 byte integer, highest order byte first - e.g. the code 'minm'
has the numeric value 1835626093.  This jumping back and forth comes
in real handy in writing code to deal with daap, as it allows you to
use switch/jump tables to react to the various codes, with a minimal
amount of hash-table lookup/string conversion/etc...)

Very early on in the DAAP conversation, a 'map' of content codes,
their long name, and their types gets sent back.  This map is used to
provide the basic description for a number of fields used in various
points further down.  See appendix A for a full listing of codes used
in the iTunes conversation.

An example, simple dmap-tagged block, the response to a /login
request:

0000000  155 154 157 147 000 000 000 044 155 163 164 164 000 000 000 004
           m   l   o   g  \0  \0  \0   $   m   s   t   t  \0  \0  \0 004
0000020  000 000 000 310 155 154 151 144 000 000 000 004 000 000 037 336
          \0  \0  \0 310   m   l   i   d  \0  \0  \0 004  \0  \0 037 336

or:
	mlog (36 bytes)
	  mstt - 200  (4 bytes)
	  mlid - 8158 (4 bytes)

NOTE: For some reason, iTunes sometimes lies about the size of the
response that its sending back, claiming to be sending back more than
it actually ends up sending.  No reason for this has been found, and
iTunes behaves properly if sent a packet with the correct size, so it
seems to be a non issue (save for possibly sloppy coding on apple's
part?).  The login response may be padded for an extra field that
doesn't always get dropped in (but iTunes always counts it).

For container types (e.g. content codes with a type 12, or list), the
data can, itself contain more code/size/data blocks.  Lists will
contain multiple code/size/data blocks, one for each item in the list.

All sizes are in bytes and count only the following data block.


IV. Client/Server conversation overview


Here's a quick diagram of the flow of requests/responses in a DAAP
session:

client				server 	Description
	  ---/server-info---->		Request for server info
	<-------msrv-------		server info response
	  ---/content-codes-->		request for content-codes
	<-------mccr-------		content-codes response
	  ---/login---------->		login
	<-------mlog-------		login response (with sessionid)
	  ---/update--------->		update request
	<-------mupd-------		update response (with server rev)
	  ---/databases------>		database request
	<-------avdb-------		data base response (with dbid)
	  ---/db/id/items---->		request songs
        <-------adbs-------		list of songs in database
	  -/db/id/containers->		request playlists
	<-------aply-------		list of playlists in database
	  -/db/id/c/id/items->		request playlist
	<-------apso-------		list of songs in playlist
	  -/db/id/c/id/items->
	<-------apso-------
	  -/db/id/c/id/items->
	<-------apso-------
	  -/db/id/c/id/items->
	<-------apso-------
	  -/db/id/items/x.mp3->		request mp3
	<--stream-mp3-file-		stream'd mp3

(For some reason, the iTunes server flags the content type as
x-dmap-tagged for the streamed mp3 - i don't know if this is laziness
on apple's part, or an intent to trip up web browsers trying to
download tracks).

The following sections will describe the requests and responses in
detail.  These sections will be expanded on ures are discovered and
documented.  (Note: daap://server can be interchanged with
http://server:3689 for purposes of coding/using command line utilities
such as curl/wget to poke at things)

1. Server Info

Request: daap://server/server-info (or http://server:3689/)
Response: msrv
Description: Provides basic negotiation info on what the server does
	and doesn't support and protocols.
Content: (See appendix A for detailed information on codes)
	msrv
	  mstt - status
	  apro - daap protocol
	  msix - does the server support indexing?
	  msex - does the server support extensions?
	  msup - does the server support update?
	  msal - does the server support auto-logout?
	  mstm - timeout interval
	  mslr - is login required?
	  msqy - does the server support queries?
	  minm - server name
	  msrs - does the server support resolve?  (needs persistent ids)
	  msbr - does the server support browsing?
  	  mspi - does the server support persistent ids?
	  mpro - dmap protocol version

	
2. Content Codes

Request: daap://server/content-codes
Response: mccr
Description: Provides a dictionary of content codes, names, and size
	information.
Content: ( See Appendix A for detailed code information )
	mccr
	  mstt		status
	  mdcl		dictionary entry (one for each type)
	    mcna	item name
	    mcnm	item number
	    mcty	item type
	
3. Login (and session id)

Request: daap://server/login
Response: mlog
Description: Provides session information to use for the rest of the
	session.  If requiresLogin is set in the server-info, then
	from this point on, a basic http authentication header needs
	to be included with the request.  It is basically a header of the
	form:
		Authentication: base64encodedusernamepassword
	where the base64 encoded password is the string:
		username:password
	base64 encoded (obviously replacing username and password with
	the appropriate values).  Username appears to be meaningless.
	A shame - i like the idea of being able to do user level
	permissions.
Content:
	mlog
	  mstt	status
	  mlid	session id (used in remaining requests <sid> below)


4. Update (and server revision)

Request: daap://server/update?session-id=<sid>
Response: mupd
Description: There seem to be two forms update requests.  The first is
	the update when logging in, to get the initial data.  The
	second (not yet documented) is to catch updates/changes to
	the server database.  Note the addition of the session-id
	from the login.
Conent:
	mupd
	  musr 	the server revision (<rid> below)
	  mstt

5. Database list

Request: daap://server/databases?session-id=<sid>&revision-id=<rid>
Response: avdb
Description: This provides a list of databases served up by the
	server.  At present, it appears that only one db per server
	is the norm, but it may be possible to have multiple servers.
Content:
	avdb
	  mstt - status
	  muty - update type - always 0 for now
	  mtco - total number of matching records
	  mrco - total number of records returned
	  mlcl - listing of records
	    mlit - single record
	      miid - database id (<dbid> in subsequent requests)
	      mper - database persistent id
	      minm - database name
	      mimc - number of items (songs) in the database
	      mctc - number of containers (playlists) in the database


	
6. Song list

Request: daap://server/databases/<dbid>/items?type=music&meta=<list of
fields>&session-id=<sid>&revision-id=<rid>
Response: apso
Description: This is the list of songs in the database.  Every song.
	Note given the format of the records and the request, I believe
	that it's possible to have other types as well.  The standard
	list of fields is (e.g. the value for meta):

		dmap.itemid,dmap.itemname,dmap.itemkind,dmap.persistentid,
		daap.songalbum,daap.songartist,daap.songbitrate,
		daap.songbeatsperminute,daap.songcomment,daap.songcompilation,
		daap.songcomposer,daap.songdateadded,daap.songdatemodified,
		daap.songdisccount,daap.songdiscnumber,daap.songdisabled,
		daap.songeqpreset,daap.songformat,daap.songgenre,
		daap.songdescription,daap.songrelativevolume,
		daap.songsamplerate,daap.songsize,daap.songstarttime,
		daap.songstoptime,daap.songtime,daap.songtrackcount,
		daap.songtracknumber,daap.songuserrating,daap.songyear,
		daap.songdatakind,daap.songdataurl,com.apple.itunes.norm-volume

	Note that in the response, it is very important that itemtype(mikd)
	be returned first for each record.  It looks like the order of the
	remaining fields can be arbitrary, but it is vital that itemid
	be first.  It also appears to be permissable to leave out fields
	that are request.  I'd imagine there is some subset of fields
	that is required, however.

Response:
	apso
	  mstt - status
	  muty - update type (0)
	  mtco - matched items
	  mrco - items in message
	  mlcl - list of items
	    mlit - single item (one per song)
	      mikd - item kind (2 for music)
	      miid - item id
	      minm - item name (e.g. the trackname)
	      ...  - the remaining fields for the track

7. Playlist list

Request: daap://server/databases/<dbid>/containers?meta=<containermeta>&session-id=<sid>&revision-id=<rid>
Response: aply
Description: provides a list of the playlists stored on the server, as
	well as some basic information about them, depending on the
	metadata that the client asks for.  So far, iTunes seems to ask
	for:
		dmap.itemid,dmap.itemname,dma.persistentid,
		com.apple.itunes.smart-playlist

Content:
	aply
	  mstt - status
	  muty - update type(0)
	  mtco - matched items
	  mrco - items in response
	  mlcl
	    mlit - playlist entry (one per playlist)
	      miid - the playlist's itemid (plid below)
	      mper - the playlist's persistent id
	      minm - the playlist's name
	      mimc - the number of items in the playlist
	      aeSP (optional) - is it a smart playlist


8. Playlist

Request: daap://server/databases/<dbid>/containers/<plid>/items?type=music&meta=<playlistmeta>&session-id=<sid>&revision-id=<rid>
Response: apso
Description: provides a list of items in the given playlist, providing
	the requested meta information for each item.  The most commonly
	requested items seem to be:

	  dmap.itemkind,dmap.itemid,dmap.containeritemid

Content:
	apso
	  mstt - status
	  muty - update type(0)
	  mtco - matched items
	  mrco - returned items
	  mlcl - list of playlist entries
	    mlit - single playlist entry (one per song)
	      mikd - item kind (2 for music)
	      miid - itemid of the song
	      containeritemid - id in the container

9. Stream song

Request: daap://server/databases/<dbid>/items/<songid>.mp3?session-id=session
Response: streamed mp3
Description: Request a song from the server.  Note that it is possible
	to use the 'range' http header to specify the range of a song,
	e.g. the start and end bytes for the track.  It's important for
	a server to support this, in case itunes users decide to jump
	around.

Content: the raw mp3 stream

Footnotes

1. It is my assumption, at least, that this is what DAAP stands for
2. Apples implementation of the zeroconf standards
3. HyperText Transport Protocol - although, these days it's shunting
around a lot more than hypertext, no?
